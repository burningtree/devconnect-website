                      When your ticket is scanned as valid, you will be given a wristband. This wristband will be your
                      access to the Cowork Space for the full week, so we advise that you wear it immediately upon
                      receipt &amp; <strong>do not lose or remove the wristband</strong> unless you no longer plan on
                      attending the Cowork Space.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you lose your wristband, you will not be granted re-entry to the venue.</p>
                    <p>
                      Once you&apos;re checked in, head over to the Swag desk to pick up any swag you may have ordered.

                We&apos;re looking for volunteers! Volunteering is often a good first step into the Ethereum ecosystem.
                If you want to experience the event from behind the scenes and contribute to its success, apply here as
                a volunteer for the Devconnect Cowork.
              </p>
              <p className="big-text margin-bottom-less">
                As a volunteer, you will not receive monetary compensation. However, you will gain valuable experience,
                networking opportunities, and access to select event areas.
              </p>
